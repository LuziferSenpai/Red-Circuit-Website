My first PC\n game was Quake2 and though I loved the single player aspect, it really \ntook off for me when I played a little map called Q2DM1 \"The Edge\". That\n map was by far the best map I ever played and to this day I remember \ngetting the double jump down pat and listening to the maps sound queues,\n to tell where my competition was. This game MADE me learn WASD and NOT \nuse the arrow keys\nFast forward to 2005 and I picked up a gem of a game called World of \nWarcraft, where I ended up meeting my amazing wifey of now 14 years. \nOriginally from Adelaide, AU, I moved to USA and have been here ever \nsince, gaming with her.\nWe play MMO's, FPS and a variety of other games. I started to stream \nseriously as of 2020 and since I am already playing the games I miles \nwell share it with you guys and meet new friends!",
