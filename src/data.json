Today I have an office job, which I am kinda bored of, so I turned to twitch to have some more fun :D. I live in the south of Germany, grew up in Dutch and got schooled in English, as such I have a weird accent :D.",

My primary genres are strategy games that require thought and planning (e.g. Factorio, Satisfactory, the Anno series), city builder/colony management games (e.g. Banished, Dawn of Man, The Universim), grand strategy games (e.g. Stellaris, the Europa Universalis series, the Crusader Kings series), stealth games like the Dishonored & Thief series, role-playing games (e.g. The Elder Scrolls series, the Fallout series), the Total War games, and a variety of MMOs. I love posting Let's Play series of various games - not exclusively among the genres listed above, but there will be a bias towards games within those genres - particularly strategy games.",
